_Backstory:_
I inherited this position from another member and the process always felt like there was room for improvement, efficiency and automation.  As most volunteer positions go, time and energy is limited and the path of least resistance was to just follow the status quo and move on.
The system wasn't broken but it is quite tedious and took up more of my time than I wanted.

The current system followed this pattern:
1. email list of trip leaders (stored on a spreadsheet) to provide parameters for their trip (date, location, time, group size, misc. notes).
2. set up registration on googleForms
3. email membership using mailChimp (over 1200 people) to announce registration
4. at closing date/time, convert googleForm response into a spreadsheet and run a random number generator to pick roughly 12 people for the trip plus 3 people for a waitlist. (adding in complicating factors like prioritizing new members and people who have sign up multiple times but haven't been picked yet-by hand and human memory.)  We tend to have 50-70 people sign up for each trip that only has room for 10-12 people.
5. create trip list of people by name and contact info (spreadsheet)
5. email registrants with their status (gmail)
6. email trip leader with the group list
7. trip leader then communicates with group and runs trip and reports back to me how the trip went, species found, pictures optional. (which I keep as a directory in google drive for archival purposes).

I imagine this project will automate and streamline many of these processes.  

At the MVP level, I imagine it could be a single registration page that members can sign up on and then on the back end the list is evaluated and generated on the parameters of group size.  The report returned will be the chosen group, waitlist and their contact info to pass onto trip leader.

I imagine the next level of this project would be for the lottery to track people and weight the system to prioritize new names, recognize over time if they have applied for trips in the past and not attended.
It should also block people from being picked that have been flagged.

Maybe there could be a way to have the trips saved on the website so the coordinator can go in and edit if people did not show or if a waitlisted person came.

Another idea to add in would be an automatic email to registrants of their status once the list is picked as well as an automatic email to the trip leader with the finalized list.

It would also be nice to have the trip leader be able to access their 'trip page' to update with their report on the location, weather, etc.
This would be full-access for the FT Coordinator, limited access for Trip leaders.

_Looking at the existing website I think it is a WordPress site using JavaScript and jQuery, Html and CSS._
