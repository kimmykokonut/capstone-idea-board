### Setup/Installation

This is just a space for brainstorming ideas.

To look at the files on your local computer:
1. Click the 'Fork' button in this repository and  you will be taken to a new page where you can give your repository a new name and description. Choose "create fork".

3. Click the 'code' button and copy the url for HTTPS.

4. On your local computer, create a working directory for my files and name appropriately.

5. On your terminal, type _$ git clone 'url'_ (using the url from step 3.)

6. On your terminal, type _$ code ._ to open in VS Code.  If you do not have VS Code Editor, you may download here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

7. Once in VS Code, make sure you have the draw.io extension installed. Instructions here: https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio

8. Now you should be able to see my idea board and my idea page.
